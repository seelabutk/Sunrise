Important Things to Cover
Purpose for this in particular:
    - Visualizing and "physicalizing" the data makes it 'real' and understandable
    - Biodiversity (& energy efficiency) are an important thing people are interested in
    - Allow people to view this from anywhere in the world
Purpose of Service as a whole:
    - Data can be sensitive to send to a client to render
    - High-detail geometry can be difficult for low-power computers to render
        - People do not like ugly visuals and are not as engaging
        - SSR allows for beautiful & stunning visuals
    - Server-Side rendering allows for both data & geometry to be rendered on powerful machinery and client can view it



[Start] -Site begins at fresh page load showing the Globe-
Talk about importance of biodiversity
Context matters for the globe (why we start at globe scale)
Mention the to-scale earth model
Introduce the service as a a whole and that it is server-side rendered
Move around the globe with the controls
Use the button to go to the Park for top-down
~30 seconds

[At the Park]
* Move around the park still using the trackball controls to show *
Talk about being able to see the overall distribution of the species
Say you want more to "experience" it
* Use the map to click a point to go into the 1st person *
Talk about being able to look around from the perspective that you are in the park itself
* Press button to move along the path of points. As we move along move the camera around to show we are able 
  to look around while traveling along the path. *
Talk about how we are on one of the most popular trails in the park, and we get to travel along it and see the biodiversity as the travelers would
* Change the species we are looking at while traveling this path *
Talk about being able to view multiple different species
* Pause playing the path *
Say that we are in an interesting spot and we want to look around
* Switch between multiple different species before landing on one *
Talk about being able to easily interact with the park and switch what we want to view
