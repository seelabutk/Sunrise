Important Things to Cover
Purpose for this in particular:
    - Biodiversity is an important thing people are interested in
    - Allow people to view this from anywhere in the world
Purpose of Service as a whole:
    - Data can be sensitive to send to a client to render
    - High-detail geometry can be difficult for low-power computers to render
    - Server-Side rendering allows for both data & geometry to be rendered on powerful machinery and client can view it
